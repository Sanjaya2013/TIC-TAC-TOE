I have developed and implement tic-tac-toe game in a pygame Framework which provide convenient environment which runs on python. In this
Project, I have created a 3x3 tic-tac-toe game. The game is designed for two players and with machine to play a game of Tic-tac-toe. The
Project contains a player X and a Opponent to place the symbol, allowing each player a turn to play the game. The program will update after
each player makes their move and will check for the conditions of the game as it goes on
